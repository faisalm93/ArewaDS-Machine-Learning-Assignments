## Regression with Scikit-learn
# Instructions
#### Take a look at the Linnerud dataset in Scikit-learn. This dataset has multiple targets: 'It consists of three exercise (data) and three physiological (target) variables collected from twenty middle-aged men in a fitness club'.

In your own words, describe how to create a Regression model that would plot the relationship between the waistline and how many situps are accomplished. Do the same for the other datapoints in this dataset.
## Solution
I have written the code and name it week4_Assignment1. This is just explanation in steps.
###### Step1
Import the necessary libraries:

###### Step2
Load the Linnerud dataset:

###### Step3
Access the data and target variables from the dataset:

###### Step4
Create a linear regression model:

###### Step5
Fit the model using the data and target:
###### Step6
Predict the target variable for the waistline feature (first column in the data):

###### Step7
Plot the relationship between waistline and situps:
