Week one of the machine learning was divided into four segment as follows: -

Introduction to Machine Learning
In this portion, I learned how to configure python working environment, relationship between Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, and applications of machine learning into our day to day activities like finance, economics, earth science, space exploration, biomedical engineering, cognitive science, and humanities.

History of Machine Learning
I learned about Notable scientist that were behind ML. The likes of Alan turin, professor John McCarthy, and Marvin Minsky. I also learned about discoveries like Bayes theorem, list square theory, nearest neighbor algorithm, and dates in the history of machine learning as summarizes below:
From the 1950s through the mid '70s, was named “The golden years”. the era where research was well funded by government agencies, advances were made in computation and algorithms, and prototypes of intelligent machines like shakey the robot, block worlds and eliza were built.
From 1974 to 1980, was called the AI winter era where funding for ML was dried up, computing power was too limited and the amount of parameters needed to be trained grew exponentially as more was asked of computers, without a parallel evolution of compute power and capability.
1980’s was an era of expert systems and neural networks. 
From 1987 to 1993, was the era where the rise of personal computers evolved. Pc’s were also competed with these large, specialized, centralized systems. The democratization of computing had begun, and it eventually paved the way for the modern explosion of big data.
From 1993 to 2011, the field began to gain maturity as it solves some of the problems that had been caused earlier by the lack of data and compute power. The amount of data began to rapidly increase and become more widely available, especially with the advent of the smartphone around 2007. 
From 2011 to date, machine learning and AI touch almost every part of our lives. This era calls for careful understanding of the risks and potentials effects of these algorithms on human lives. As Microsoft's Brad Smith has stated, "Information technology raises issues that go to the heart of fundamental human-rights protections like privacy and freedom of expression. These issues heighten responsibility for tech companies that create these products.

Fairness in Machine Learning
I learned about the importance of fairness in machine learning, fairness related harms like allocation, quality of service, stereotyping, denigration and over or under representation as well as an introduction to an open-source Python package that allows you to assess your systems' fairness and mitigate unfairness called Fairlearn. 

Techniques of Machine Learning
 I learned the process of developing machine learning models, which includes decision questions based on data collection, cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection and training, and evaluation and testing.
